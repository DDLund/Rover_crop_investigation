# Rover Crop Investigation

Here we are provided a method for cropping images of a mars rover based on canny edge detection.

Our first task is to tweak the provided method so that it crops out the portion of the image, rover.jpg, that makes up the rover body, while masking the landscape. We also need to make sure the method does not crop the shadows in rover2.jpg, as the method should not identify shadows caused by the mars rover as rover parts.

Our second task is to test this method to see how well it will generalize.
